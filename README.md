# fireprofile
Minimalistic Firefox profile launcher making use of dmenu

## Why
Switching profiles in Firefox is inconvenient - as a user I want to select
which profile to start even before launching browser. Fireprofile lets you
choose profile from list.

## For whom
Fireprofile was implemneted with minimalistic desktop environments/window managers
in mind. For example if you are using i3-wm and dmenu for running applications
then Fireprofile will be perfect fit.

## Installation
1. Copy `fireprofile` into a directory in your `PATH`
2. Copy `fireprofile.desktop` into ~/.local/share/applications`.

Dependencies:
- Bash
- dmenu
- Firefox :)
